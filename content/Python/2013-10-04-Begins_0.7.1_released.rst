Begins 0.7.1 released
#####################

I released version 0.7 and 0.7.1 of `Begins`_ this week. 0.7.1 was a bug fix
release for an issue discovered shortly after releasing 0.7. A number of
significant features were delivered in 0.7, including:

* `automatic type conversion`_
* `command line flags`_
* `multiple sub commands`_
* `program execution context`_

These new features enable writing a simple `Flask`_ web applications like:

.. code:: python

    import begin
    from twoslug import app

    @begin.start(auto_convert=True)
    def main(host='127.0.0.1', port=8000, debug=False):
        app.run(host=host, port=port, debug=debug)

Begins both ensures that the correct, expected, types are passed to the main
function as well as presenting ``debug`` as a command line flag rather than an
option argument. The help output for the application is:

.. code::

    usage: run.py [--help] [--host HOST] [--port PORT] [--debug]

    optional arguments:
      --help                show this help message and exit
      --host HOST, -h HOST  (default: 127.0.0.1)
      --port PORT, -p PORT  (default: 8000)
      --debug, -d           (default: False)

This is the actual `development server`_ I have been using while developing
`TwoSlug`_.

Begins really should have had a beta release by now. (It's currently still in
alpha). The only thing preventing a beta is the lack of proper documentation
hosted on `Read The Docs`_. My intention is to focus solely on documentation
for the upcoming 0.8 release, which will be the first beta. That's my intention
anyway, the strength of my convictions remains to be seen.
