About
-----

I am a senior software developer with the Australian government. With ten years
of experience, I'm responsible for providing both technical leadership and
mentoring for junior staff. On any given day I may need to develop or maintain
software using Python, C, C++, Bash, PHP, Javascript, XML and XSLT. But my
specialisation is the delivery of novel, quick reaction capabilities to meet
operational needs.

When not at the office or tending to my family with two little girls, I work on
my open source projects. The most finished of these are listed on my `Projects
<|filename|projects.rst>`_ page. The code for these projects, including other
less complete projects, is hosted on my `Github <https://github.com/aliles>`_
site.
